# Cognitive modeling

This repository contains the code and slides for the Cognitive Modeling course at the University of California, Irvine.  This is an incomplete companion repository to the course website on Canvas, and a lot of the materials here may not make sense in isolation.  

In the interest of transparency, note that some of the materials here are generated with support from generative AI tools such as Cursor, ChatGPT, and Gemini.

> [!WARNING] 
> Some of the code in this repository may be intentionally flawed or incomplete, and none of it should be used for research or publication.  For this reason...
